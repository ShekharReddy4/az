Arrays - DS
An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of
memory. 

In an array,A , of size N, each memory location has some unique index i, (where 0<= i < N),
that can be referenced as A[i](you may also see it written as Ai).
Given an array,A , of N integers, print each element in reverse order as a single line of space-separated
integers.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, N(the number of integers in A).
The second line onwards N elements on a new line.

Constraints
1<=N<=10^3
1<=A[i]<=10^4 where A[i] is the ith integer in Array A

Output Format
Print all N integers of Array A in reverse order on a new line.
