Given a square matrix where elements are inserted as 1 to n in new lines and you traverse the matrix in spiral manner, find the kth number you will visit.

Example:
n = 3
Note :- For Demonstration elements are shown in matrix format

input=
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

k = 4, output: 6
k = 6, output: 8

Constraints :- N >= 1 and N <= 10^2
k >=1 and <= N*N

Note :- for Boundary conditions print -1

First Line contains the size of the matrix N * N 
Second Line onwards Array Elements 
Last Read the k postion
